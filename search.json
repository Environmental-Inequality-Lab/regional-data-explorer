    "text": "PopulationRace & EthnicityIncome\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends and Age Dynamics\nPopulation Density (Hex Grid), 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: Map uses a hexagonal grid to show population counts within each cell. Population is represented on a log scale, with blue-purple hexagons indicating fewer people and red-yellow hexagons indicating more. Legend is restricted to the 2nd–98th percentiles. Data source: Gridded EIF.\n\n\nWhere People Live\nIn 2024, Albemarle County was home to 107,686 people. In the map above, darker blue areas indicate less populated regions. Warmer colors indicate more populated areas.\nThe region had a population density of 58 people per square kilometer, which is more dense than the national average of 37 per square kilometer.\n\n\nPopulation Trends\nThe population grew by 39,170 people between 2000 and 2024, with an average annual growth rate of 1.9%. This is faster than the national average growth rate of 0.8%.\nFrom 2000-2010, the population grew at an average annual rate of 2.53%. From 2010-2020, it grew at a rate of 1.62% annually. And from 2020-2024, it grew by 1.05% annually.\nPopulation Growth, 2000-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: Line chart shows annual population from 2000 to 2024. Population is shown on the vertical axis; year is on the horizontal axis. Data source: Gridded EIF.\n\n\nAge Dynamics\nIn 2024, 19% of the Albemarle County population was under 18, a lower share than the US. The under-18 population was declining.\nIn 2024, 58% of the Albemarle County population was aged 19-65, a lower share than the US. The 19-65 population was declining.\nIn 2024, 21% of the Albemarle County population was over 65, a higher share than the US. The over-65 population was growing.\nPopulation Age Shares, 2000-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: Line chart shows the share of the population in three age groups—under 18, ages 19–65, and over 65—for each year from 2000 to 2024. The vertical axis shows population share as a percentage. Data source: Gridded EIF.\n\n\n\n\nLocal and National Trends in Racial and Ethnic Population Size and Share (2000-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: The trend lines show how the population has changed over time within Albemarle County. An upward-sloping line indicates population growth.\n\n\nComparison of 2024 Racial Shares\nIndividuals are characterized as Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian, and Non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN). A residual category is constructed containing all Non-Hispanic Other, but is not reported separately in the statistics.\n\nWhite individuals made up 71.9% of the Albemarle County population, compared to 55.0% nationwide.\nBlack individuals made up 8.2% of the Albemarle County population, compared to 11.6% nationwide.\nHispanic individuals made up 4.5% of the Albemarle County population, compared to 15.8% nationwide.\nAsian individuals made up 3% of the Albemarle County population, compared to 4.1% nationwide.\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) individuals made up 0.2% of the Albemarle County population, compared to 0.8% nationwide.\n\n\n\nPopulation Maps by Race and Ethnicity (2024)\nSpatial Distribution of White Population, 2024 \nSpatial Distribution of Black Population, 2024 \nSpatial Distribution of Hispanic Population, 2024 \nSpatial Distribution of Asian Population, 2024 \nSpatial Distribution of AIAN Population, 2024 \nFigure Notes: Red-yellow hexagons represent higher concentrations of each racial group and blue-purple hexagons represent lower concentrations. The scales vary to reflect differences in overall population levels across groups.\n\n\n\n\nIncome Trends and Shares\nThe average household income in 2024 was 213,759 dollars. The average annual growth rate was 1.3% compared with the US annual growth rate of 3.7%.\nAlbemarle County Income Decile Distribution, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: The figure shows the share of the Albemarle County population within each decile of the national income distribution.\n\n\nIncome Deciles and AGI\nIncome deciles divide the national population into ten equally sized income bins. The first decile reflects the 10% of the US population with the lowest income, while the 10th decile reflects the 10% of the population with the highest income.\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI) is defined as the total gross income per household minus specific adjustments.\nAnnual AGI Growth, 2000-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Notes: The table shows the average income level for each decile group in 2024. The annual growth represents the average annual change in income from 2000 to 2024. Positive values represent an increase in average income while negative values represent a decrease in average income.\n\n\nRace-Income Trends and Shares\nThe population with the highest average income was the Asian population and the population with the lowest average income was the Black population. The population with the highest average annual income growth rate from 2000–2024 was the Asian population and the population with the lowest average annual growth rate was the Black population.\nAnnual Income Growth Rates, By Race/Ethnicity, 2000-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Notes: The table shows the average household income and the average growth rate over the last 25 years by race. Higher growth rates indicate faster growth over time.\nRace-Specific Income Distributions: Albemarle County vs. US, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: The dark blue bars show the share of the population within each decile of the national income distribution for each race in Albemarle County, while the light blue bars show the income decile distributions for every race in the US. The set of figures shows how race-specific income distributions in Albemarle County differ from US race-specific income distributions. Differences between the dark and light blue lines indicate a difference between the Albemarle County and US income distributions for the given decile.\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Environmental Inequality Lab.\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to inform interested parties of research and to encourage discussion.

Organized on a fixed 0.01° x 0.01° grid (approximately 1 km² × 1 km²), the Gridded EIF provides population counts by age, sex, race and ethnicity, as well as race-specific population counts by household income decile from administrative tax records. This structure enables more spatially precise analysis than traditional place-based data while maintaining strict confidentiality standards.\nEstimates reflect the most detailed available data on the local population, though some figures may understate true counts.
