In the map below, cooler colors (such as blue and purple) indicate less populated regions, while warmer colors (such as yellow and red) indicate more populated areas.\nAlbemarle County had a population density of 58 people per square kilometer, which is more dense than the national average of 37 people per square kilometer.\nAlbemarle County Population, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: The map uses a hexagonal grid to display population counts within each cell. Population values are shown on a log scale, with blue-purple hexagons indicating fewer people and red-yellow hexagons indicating more. The legend is restricted to the 2nd–98th percentiles. Data source: Gridded EIF.\n\n\nPopulation Trend\nThe Albemarle County population grew by 39,170 people between 2000 and 2024, with an average annual growth rate of 1.9%.

The ‘Population Trend’ shows the change in absolute population, while the ‘Population Share Trend’ shows the change in the group’s percentage of the total. The final column shows the national share trend for comparison.\n\n\nPopulation Maps by Race and Ethnicity\nAlbemarle County White Population, 2024 \nFigure Notes: The map uses a hexagonal grid to display population counts within each cell.

AGI is aggregated to the household level.\nIn 2024, the average household AGI in Albemarle County was 213,759 dollars. The average annual growth rate in household AGI was 1.3%, compared with the U.S. average annual household AGI growth growth rate of 3.7%.\n\n\nIncome Distribution\nIncome deciles divide the national population into ten equally sized AGI groups. The first decile represents the 10% of the U.S. population with the lowest AGI, while the tenth decile represents the 10% with the highest AGI.\nAlbemarle County Adjusted Gross Income Distribution, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: The figure shows the share of the Albemarle County population within each decile of the national AGI distribution. A bar above 10% indicates the county has a higher-than-average share of people in that national income bracket; a bar below 10% indicates a lower-than-average share.\n\n\nIncome Growth\nThe table below summarizes average household AGI by decile in 2024, along with annual AGI growth rates from 2000 to 2024. Each decile represents 10% of the population, ranked from lowest to highest income. The table also provides national averages for comparison. Positive growth rates indicate increases in average AGI over time, while negative values indicate declines.\nAnnual Adjusted Gross Income Growth by Decile, 2000-2024\n(On smaller screens or certain browsers, use the scrollbar at the bottom of the table to view all columns. Click column headers to sort values.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Notes: Values represent average household Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and corresponding annual growth rates for each income decile from 2000 to 2024.\n\n\nIncome by Race & Ethnicity\nThe Asian population had the highest average household AGI, while the Black population had the lowest. From 2000 to 2024, the Asian population experienced the highest average annual AGI growth rate, whereas the Black population had the lowest.\nAnnual AGI Growth Rates, By Race & Ethnicity, 2000-2024\n(On smaller screens or certain browsers, use the scrollbar at the bottom of the table to view all columns. Click column headers to sort values.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Notes: The table presents average household AGI and the average annual AGI growth rate from 2000 to 2024 by race. Higher growth rates indicate faster increases in income over time.\nRace-Specific Adjusted Gross Income Distribution in Albemarle County vs. the United States, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Notes: Dark blue bars represent the share of each racial and ethnic group within each decile of the national AGI distribution in Albemarle County. Light blue bars show the corresponding national distribution for each group. Together, these figures illustrate how AGI is distributed across racial and ethnic groups locally versus nationally. Differences between the dark and light blue bars indicate deviations between the Albemarle County and U.S. AGI distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Environmental Inequality Lab.\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to inform interested parties of research and to encourage discussion.

    "text": "The Data Source\nThe Gridded Environmental Impacts Frame (Gridded EIF) is an innovative, privacy-protected dataset derived from the Census Bureau’s confidential Environmental Impacts Frame (EIF) microdata. Organized on a fixed 0.01° x 0.01° grid (approximately 1 km² × 1 km²), the Gridded EIF provides population counts by age, sex, race and ethnicity, as well as race-specific population counts by household income decile from administrative tax records. This structure enables more spatially precise analysis than traditional place-based data while maintaining strict confidentiality standards.\nEstimates reflect the most detailed available data on the local population, though some figures may understate true counts. Please see https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/gridded-eif.html for more information."
