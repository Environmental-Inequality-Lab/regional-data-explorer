    "text": "The Data Source\nThe Gridded Environmental Impacts Frame (Gridded EIF) is an innovative, privacy-protected dataset derived from the Census Bureau’s confidential Environmental Impacts Frame (EIF) microdata. Organized on a fixed 0.01° x 0.01° grid (approximately 1 km² × 1 km²), the Gridded EIF provides population counts by age, sex, race and ethnicity, as well as race-specific population counts by household income decile from administrative tax records. This structure enables more spatially precise analysis than traditional place-based data while maintaining strict confidentiality standards.\nEstimates reflect the most detailed available data on the local population, though some figures may understate true counts. Please see https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/gridded-eif.html for more information."
