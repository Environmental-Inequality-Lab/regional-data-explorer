Each hexagon represents the average PM2.5 level in that spatial cell, with darker shades indicating higher concentrations. The legend is restricted to the 2nd–98th percentiles. Data source: WUSTL Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group.\n\n## Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)\n\nPM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter. These tiny particles are a type of air pollution that can come from sources like vehicle emissions, industrial processes, wildfires, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Because of their small size, PM2.5 particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing health risks such as respiratory problems, heart disease, and premature death.\n\nThe map above shows where PM2.5 is highest (darker) and lowest (lighter) in the county.\n\n## County PM2.5 Stats\n\n\nIn 2023, the average resident of **Albemarle County** was exposed to **8.45** micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5—roughly equivalent to smoking **139** cigarettes in a year. This is **2.9%** lower than the national average of **8.7** micrograms per cubic meter and represents a **44.9%** decrease since 2000. The regulatory standard for PM2.5 exposure in the US is 9 micrograms per cubic meter. Approximately **3.7%** of **Albemarle County** residents lived in areas exceeding the standard, **91.1%** lower than the national average of **41.3%**.\n\n## Exposure By Race/Ethnicity\n\n\n\nIn **Albemarle County**, **Black** residents experienced the highest levels of PM2.5 exposure, and **Black** residents experienced PM2.5 levels above the national standard at the highest rate relative to other racial groups. PM$_{2.5}$ exposure for AIAN residents is higher than the national average, but lower than the national average for Black, Asian, Hispanic, and White residents.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](pm25_files/figure-html/sparkline_race-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotes: Table shows average PM2.5 exposure by race/ethnicity in 2023, with trends from 2000–2023. Values reflect micrograms per cubic meter. Percent columns report the share of each group living in areas exceeding the 2024 annual PM2.5 standard, both locally and nationally. Data source: Gridded EIF, WUSTL Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group.\n\n## Exposure By Income Decile\n\n\nResidents in the **lowest** income deciles in **Albemarle County** had the highest exposure to PM2.5 and had the highest rate of experiencing levels of PM2.5 that exceed the national standard. The **tenth** income decile had the lowest PM2.5 exposure and the **tenth** income decile had the lowest percent exposed to levels of PM2.5 exceeding the national standard. The **second** income decile had the highest average level of PM2.5 exposure, and the **fourth** income decile had the highest rate of areas exceeding the national standard.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](pm25_files/figure-html/sparkline_inc-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nNotes: Table shows average PM2.5 exposure by income decile in 2023, with trends from 2000–2023.

Each line corresponds to a racial or ethnic group, and each point represents the group’s average exposure within a given income decile.
