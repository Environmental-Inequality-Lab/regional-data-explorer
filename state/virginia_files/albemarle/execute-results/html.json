AGI is aggregated to the household level.\n\nIn 2024, the average household AGI in Albemarle County  was 213,759 dollars. The average annual growth rate in household AGI was 1.3%, compared with the U.S. average annual household AGI growth growth rate of 3.7%.\n\n### Income Distribution\n\nIncome deciles divide the national population into ten equally sized AGI groups. The first decile represents the 10% of the U.S. population with the lowest AGI, while the tenth decile represents the 10% with the highest AGI.\n\n**Albemarle County Adjusted Gross Income Distribution, 2024**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](albemarle_files/figure-html/income-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n*Figure Notes: The figure shows the share of the Albemarle County population within each decile of the national AGI distribution. A bar above 10% indicates the county has a higher-than-average share of people in that national income bracket; a bar below 10% indicates a lower-than-average share.*\n\n### Income Growth\n\nThe table below summarizes average household AGI by decile in 2024, along with annual AGI growth rates from 2000 to 2024. Each decile represents 10% of the population, ranked from lowest to highest income. The table also provides national averages for comparison. Positive growth rates indicate increases in average AGI over time, while negative values indicate declines.\n\n**Annual Adjusted Gross Income Growth by Decile, 2000-2024**\n\n*(On smaller screens or certain browsers, use the scrollbar at the bottom of the table to view all columns.
